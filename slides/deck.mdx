### Types of animation

- keyframes/transitions (great for simple animations)
- js animations (rAF or WAAPI) (great for more complicated but less performance heavy animations, bad support on WAAPI)
- canvas (powerful but not very accessible)
- canvas WebGL (powerful, hardware accelerated, 3D, but hard. Or is it?)
