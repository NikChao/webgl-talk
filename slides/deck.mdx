# Cooking WebGL
### with react-three-fiber
---

### Animation technologies

- keyframes/transitions
<!-- great for simple animations) -->
- js animations (rAF or WAAPI)
<!-- (great for more complicated but less performance heavy animations, bad support for WAAPI right now) -->
- canvas
<!-- powerful but not very accessible) -->
- **WebGL**
<!-- (powerful, hardware accelerated, 3D, but hard. Or is it?)** -->

---

### WebGL

---

### A few concepts
- **Vertex**
- **Vertex Shaders** 
<!-- transforms code from original coordinate system to the clipspace coordinate system used by WebGL (-1, +1) and assigns it to a variable called **gl_Position** -->
- **Fragment Shaders**
<!-- called once for every pixel for every shape to be drawn. It's job is to figure out the colour to apply to the pixel. This takes lighting, textures, etc. into account. -->
- A vertex + fragment shader together make up a **program**.

---

### Boilerplate
- Shaders need to be
  - initialised
  - compiled
  - loaded into the WebGL context
- Buffers 
<!-- need to be allocated for passing data to and from your shaders -->
- Create a perspective
- Bind buffers

---

- 3D Rendering: rendering many elements at different orrientations
<!-- cube example -->

- Animation: updating vertex positions with matrix transformations

- Lighting: involves even more matrices and complicated logic

<!-- If this is a cube could you imagine making a sphere? Or fluids movement? -->

---

### WebGL Example

---

### A lot to think about

---

### Three.js

---

### Concepts
- scene
<!-- Scenes allow you to set up what and where is to be rendered by three.js. This is where you place objects, lights and cameras. -->
- cameras
- lights
- mesh
  - geometries
  - materials

---

### ThreeJS example

---


### What can we make easier?
- State: need to manage your scene state
- No handlers, interactions with objects is verbose
<div style={{ paddingLeft: '20%', paddingTop: '30px', width: '100%' }}>
  <img style={{ backgroundColor: 'whitesmoke', left: '40%', height: '400px', width: 'auto' }} src="./raycaster.jpg" />
</div>

---

### react-three-fiber

---

- React renderer for threejs
- Uses heuristics for objects and attributes
- Handlers included
- We can now make reusable, declarative trees for our canvas!

---

### react-three-fiber example

---

### Caveats

- Easy to write unperformant code
- Still need to do some things imperatively
- Handlers are always quite naive (on purpose)
